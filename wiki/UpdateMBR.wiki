= Update the boot disk MBR with gptsync =

= Introduction =

The installation of GRUB will also install a grub MBR (master boot record). The AppleTV does not use this MBR but the MBR has to be one that is compatible with gpt formated partitions. The AppleTV efi firmware and boot.efi are picky about the master boot record (MBR). While the AppleTV will eventually boot atv-bootloader with a "wrong" flavor MBR, it might take 30-60 seconds before it tries. We fix this by syncing the MBR with the gpt created formats.

= Details =

In order to sync the MBR with the gpt partitions we need to use gptsync. Of course, there current apt-get version does not understand recovery partitions so we need to build the updated version.

{{{
# get the current source for gptsync which is in "refit" source
wget http://superb-west.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/refit/refit-src-0.11.tar.gz
tar -xzf refit-src-0.11.tar.gz 

# make just gptsync
cd refit-src-0.11/gptsync
sudo make -f Makefile.unix
sudo cp gptsync /usr/bin/
sudo ldconfig

sudo gptsync /dev/sda
}}}

The other method to fix the slow boot time is to replace the grub MBR with a safe one
