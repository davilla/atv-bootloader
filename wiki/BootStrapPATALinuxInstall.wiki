= Partition for Bootstrap Linux Install =

This is the easiest partition method. There are no prep steps. You boot a [BootingLiveCD CD installer using atv-bootloader], then install to the internal PATA disk over-writing everything on it. Make sure you [ATVBackup backup your AppleTV] so you can return to the factory AppleTV OS if desired.

You will need to make sure "com.apple.Boot.plist" on the recovery partition of the USB flash disk has the the atv-boot parameter of "auto"
{{{
<string>atv-boot=auto video=vesafb</string>
}}}

When "auto" is selected, atv-bootloader will search for a GRUB menu.lst and kexec boot the default kernel.

= Usage = 

When the AppleTV is powered-on, Apple EFI firmware will look for a "Recovery" partition. It will find the one on the USB flash drive and boot atv-bootloader which then searches for valid GRUB menu.lst boot settings. Atv-bootloader will in turn use these boot settings to kexec boot that the default kernel.
