This blog contains the development notes of what I'm working on. Check back frequently and you can see what I'm currently doing regarding atv-bootloader and Linux installation.

Grrrr, last night was a bust, blocked at every turn. I was trying the get KnoppMyth to install onto a disk with GPT format. I think there is a way to shortcut the installer so I'm not forced to use cfdisk to partition, but I needed to build parted and hfs support. Of course, there was no room on the ramdisk that the installer uses. So tonight's exercise will be re-installing KnoppMyth the original way, building the apps I need, slipping them onto the atv-bootloader pen drive on a ext2 partition. Then try the shortcut again but this time I will have the partitioning support rebuilt and I should be able to slip them into the ramdisk filesytem. In theory -). More later tonight when I get home.

Think I have it. It's tricky but you have to do the KnoppMyth install using normal partitioning, but after getting the six choice dialog, atl-F2 into a console and re-partition the disk GPT with first three like KnoppMyth wants and a fourth being "Recovery". AppleTV efi firmware does not care which partition is "Recovery" so make it the last one so KnoppMyth does not get confused.  You have to do it this way because the KnoppMyth install script does not understand GPT partitions and the only choice is to partition. Once you partition, then you get the six choice dialog.

Also KnoppMyth does not seem to pay attention to loading module options so we have to force our options. Edit "/etc/rc.local" and add
{{{
modprobe -r usbhid
modprobe usbhid quirks=0x05ac:0x8241:0x10
modprobe -r nvidia
modprobe nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords="PerfLevelSrc=0x2222" NVreg_Mobile=0
}}}

This unloads usbhid and nvidia modules, then loads them with a) usbhid quirk to enable the AppleTV IR controller and b) nvidia with mobile and powermiser disabled so we can underclock the gpu. Notice that with a) now we don't have to patch and recompile the kernel, yea. This change will be propagated to the other distro installs once I get a chance to verify.

Blog created, Doing real work right now so no updates until I get home later.

8:14pm - home again, now it's play time. 1st thing on the list is patch generation for IR and audio for an unreleased distro. Nothing new, same old kernel patches. For those unfamiliar with the process, you take the existing patch and try to apply using dry-run. If it works you're done. If not, then you need to figure out what's wrong and manually fix the patch. The target kernel is question is version 2.6.23. Not too old but the typical problem of the kernel not knowing about the AppleTV device IDs. The patches I'm generating here are going to be pushed upstream to the devs that handle the distro so they can include it in their next release. 

The IR patch is dirt simple, This fixes "usbhid.ko" with four lines of code to add to "drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-quirks.c". The current patch applies without problem so done here.

Audio is also simple, this fixes "snd-hda-intel.ko" and gets applied to "sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c". This patch is redundant as this distro uses ALSA for audio support and ALSA builds it's own "snd-hda-intel.ko" which will overwrite the kernel version.  So we will also have to fix "snd-hda-intel.ko" in ALSA which is at "alsa-kernel/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c". It might seem silly to patch the kernel version but I do this just in case ALSA somehow did not get installed. The ALSA fix is more complicated as the current patch does not apply properly as the ALSA version of "patch_realtek.c" is newer than that in 2.6.23 and it's internal structure has changed. Life in the patch/update lane. 

We are patching alsa-driver-hg20080219 and we just need to test that the AppleTV audio device is detected and both analog and digital audio work properly. So just rebuild the driver, I'm not sure what configure parms the distro uses but we need "--with-cards=hda-intel".
{{{
cd alsa-driver-hg20080219 
./configure --with-cards=hda-intel 
make 
make install 
./snddevices 
}}}

To save the reboot, manually unload the old module, load the new one and check dmesg to see if the AppleTV audio device is detected.
{{{
root#modprobe -r snd-hda-intel
root#modprobe -v snd-hda-intel
root#dmesg | grep hda_codec
hda_codec: Detected AppleTV RealTek Subsystem ID
}}}

Bingo, there it is. Run "alsamixer and un-mute the digital output and I should hear audio over both analog and digital output. Note that digital audio over HDMI does not work yet but it is an ongoing project.

Once I test everything, and am confident that all is good, I generate diifs from the original code and the patched code,  then ship them upstream to the distro devs.

12:05am - done patching/building/testing and everything looks good so off the patches go swimming their way upstream. Memo to self, need to pull the dev source for ALSA and the kernel, create patches and submit them so they get into mainline source code.
