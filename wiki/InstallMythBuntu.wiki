= Install MythBuntu 7.10 =

== Introduction ==

This assumes that you followed the partitioning instructions  [PartitioningLinux here] and are now ready to install [http://www.mythbuntu.org/ MythBuntu] from the LiveCD.

== Details ==

* Install Mythbuntu
   This assumes /dev/sda4 is "/" and /dev/sda5 is "swap"

   Click on install "Mythbuntu"

   Prepare disk space
{{{
select "Manual"
}}}

   Prepare Partitions
{{{
select /dev/sda4 and "edit"
change "use as" to ext3
change mount point to "/" (without quotes)
check the format check box.

select /dev/sda5 and "edit"
change "use as" to swap
}}}

    Now follow the normal mythbuntu install but do no reboot yet and remember to 
{{{

* Fix console framebuffer support
   Ubuntu has a strange console framebuffer setup so we need to fix it for the AppleTV.

   Unplug/replug USB drive to get the partitions mounted. The rest assumes the USB disk is mounted at /media/disk
{{{
mount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev
chroot /media/disk
df to make sure you are in the correct root filesystem
"/" should be mounted on /dev/sda4

nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer and comment out "blacklist vesafb"
	#blacklist vesafb

nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add 
	fbcon
	vesafb

update-initramfs -u

exit
umount /media/disk/dev
}}}
