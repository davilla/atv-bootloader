* fix console framebuffer support
{{{
Ubuntu has a strange console framebuffer setup so we need to fix it for the AppleTV

unplug/replug USB drive to get the partitions mounted
The rest assumes the USB disk is mounted at /media/disk

mount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev
chroot /media/disk
df to make sure you are in the correct root filesystem
"/" should be mounted on /dev/sda4

nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer and comment out "blacklist vesafb"
	#blacklist vesafb

nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add 
	fbcon
	vesafb

update-initramfs -u

exit
umount /media/disk/dev
