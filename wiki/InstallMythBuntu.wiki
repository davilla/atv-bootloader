= Install [http://www.mythbuntu.org/ MythBuntu] 7.10 =

== Introduction ==

This assumes that you followed the partitioning instructions  [PartitioningLinux here] and are now ready to install [http://www.mythbuntu.org/ MythBuntu] from the LiveCD using a normal PC hardware platform.

== Details ==

* Install Mythbuntu
   This assumes /dev/sda4 is "/" and /dev/sda5 is "swap"

   Click on install "Mythbuntu"

   Prepare disk space
{{{
select "Manual"
}}}

   Prepare Partitions
{{{
select /dev/sda4 and "edit"
change "use as" to ext3
change mount point to "/" (without quotes)
check the format check box.

select /dev/sda5 and "edit"
change "use as" to swap
}}}

    Now follow the normal mythbuntu install but do no reboot yet and remember to 
{{{
select mac mini IR driver
select nvidia-new driver
select and configure the display settings for your monitor
}}}

* Fix console framebuffer support
   Ubuntu has a strange console framebuffer setup so we need to fix it for the AppleTV.

   Unplug/replug USB drive to get the partitions mounted. The rest assumes the USB disk is mounted at /media/disk
{{{
mount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev
chroot /media/disk
df to make sure you are in the correct root filesystem
"/" should be mounted on /dev/sda4

nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer and comment out "blacklist vesafb"
	#blacklist vesafb

nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add 
	fbcon
	vesafb

update-initramfs -u

exit
umount /media/disk/dev
}}}

* Running Mythbuntu

   There are a few things to complete the install once you have MythBuntu running. First open the Update Manager and take all the updates. If you are trying to match an existing MythTV backend, you might want to check the versions of MythTV and match them (outside the scope of this document). 
   Next, fix the nvidia binary driver so you do not get nvidia xvmc related hangs/video corruption when doing xvmc assisted mpeg2 decode/display. This simple step took me months to resolve. This assumes that the nvidia binary driver is installed and is used for X11 display.
{{{
# from a terminal window, enable coolbits so we can change the nvidia gpu clock
nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=1 --no-composite --no-logo

# nvidia-settings is used to change the gpu clock but,
#   we want it to always be applied on startup of X11
sudo nano /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc
nvidia-settings -a GPUOverclockingState=1
nvidia-settings -a GPU2DClockFreqs=200,800

# pickup the new settings
sudo reboot
