A few things to check.

= X11 fails to launch =
Some Linux installers will place "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe" for X11 to use if it encounters a failure in loading "/etc/X11/xorg.conf". Sometimes this failsafe is not correct and will fail to load. 

Once X11 starts using the "/etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe", it becomes "stuck" using it and will not use "/etc/X11/xorg.conf". 

The solution is to "sudo rm "/etc/X11/xorg.conf. failsafe". Now you can fix "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" and move on.
