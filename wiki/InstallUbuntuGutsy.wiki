= Install [http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/ Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy] =

= *WARNING UNDER CONSTRUCTION* =

== Introduction ==

This assumes that you followed the partitioning instructions  [PartitioningLinux here] and are now ready to install [http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download/ Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy] from a LiveCD using a normal PC hardware platform.

== Details ==

* Install Ubuntu Gutsy
   This assumes /dev/sda4 is "/" and /dev/sda5 is "swap"

   Click on install "Mythbuntu"

   Prepare disk space
{{{
select "Manual"
}}}

   Prepare Partitions
{{{
select /dev/sda4 and "edit"
change "use as" to ext3
change mount point to "/" (without quotes)
check the format check box.

select /dev/sda5 and "edit"
change "use as" to swap

It's ok to install grub, we will need the grub structure (menu.lst) to boot.
we will replace the grub MBR with one that efi firmware likes
so that the boot to the tux/atv logo drops form 30-60 seconds to 11.
we do this later when the install is running native on the AppleTV.
}}}

* Fix console framebuffer support
   Ubuntu has a strange console framebuffer setup so we need to fix it for the AppleTV.

   Unplug/replug USB drive to get the partitions mounted. The rest assumes the USB disk is mounted at /media/disk
{{{
sudo mount --bind /dev /media/disk/dev
#
sudo chroot /media/disk
df to make sure you are in the correct root filesystem
"/" should be mounted on /dev/sda4

#install ssh
#sudo apt-get install openssh-server

sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-new
sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
sudo nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=1 --no-composite --no-logo

nano /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-framebuffer and comment out "blacklist vesafb"
	#blacklist vesafb

nano /etc/initramfs-tools/modules and add 
	fbcon
	vesafb

update-initramfs -u

exit
sudo umount /media/disk/dev
}}}

   Now you can a) reinstall the drive back into the AppleTV or b) install the drive into a 2.5 to USB drive adapter. Power on the AppleTV and you should see the tux/atv logo in 30-60 seconds. Then you will see atv-bootloader booting (tux in the upper left corner). After that you linux install should boot. If you are using a USB drive converter, you might have to use the IR remote and press "menu" and "-" buttons down during power on to force a USB recovery boot.

* Running Ubuntu Gutsy

   There are a few things to complete the install once you have Ubuntu running. First open the Update Manager and take all the updates then reboot. 
   
   Fix the nvidia binary driver so you do not get nvidia xvmc related hangs/video corruption when doing xvmc assisted mpeg2 decode/display. This simple step took me months to resolve. This assumes that the nvidia binary driver is installed and is used for X11 display. This is working for 169.xx nvidia driver series and might also work with the installed 100.14.19 version.
{{{
#------------------------------------------------
# from a terminal window, enable coolbits so we can change the nvidia gpu clock
nvidia-xconfig --cool-bits=1 --no-composite --no-logo

# really enable nvidia gpu to be underclocked, the AppleTV is a 7300 mobile chipset
# normally mobile chipsets are not allowed to have clock changes so we have to do
# some nvidia voodoo commands. I've seen two places to add this,
#  a) /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-kernel-nkc
#  b) /etc/modprobe.d/options
#
# both locations seem to work for me.
#
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia-kernel-nkc
options nvidia NVreg_RegistryDwords="PerfLevelSrc=0x2222" NVreg_Mobile=0

# nvidia-settings is used to actually change the gpu clock but,
# we want it to always be applied after the startup of X11. We create an 
# autostart entry for the username that was setup during the install. 
# I'm using "user" here, you should replace "user" with your username.
#
sudo nano /home/user/.config/autostart/nvidia_fixes.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
Version=0.9.4
Type=Application
Name=nvidia xvmc hang fixup
Comment=fixes nvidia problems with xvmc decode
Exec=/usr/sbin/nvidia_hang_fix.sh
StartupNotify=false
Terminal=false
Hidden=false

# now create the actual script
sudo nano /usr/sbin/nvidia_hang_fix.sh
#!/bin/bash
nvidia-settings -a GPUOverclockingState=1
nvidia-settings -a GPU2DClockFreqs=200,800

# change the file permission so it can execute
sudo chmod 755 /usr/sbin/nvidia_hang_fix.sh

# when X11 is up on the next reboot, you can verify the gpu clock change
# by doing the following in a terminal window and look for "GPU2DClockFreqs". 
# You should see 200 for gpu and 800 for vram and NOT 360 for gpu and 720 for vram.
#
sudo nvidia-settings -q all

   Patch the Realtek audio module to correctly identify the AppleTV and enable analog (rca) output. This involves patching the existing linux-ubuntu-modules-2.6.22-2.6.22 install, so remember that if you allows this to be updated in the future, you will have to reapply this patch. Thanks to Jason (SredniV in the MythBuntu forums) for figuring out the deb part.

   The AppleTV efi firmware and boot.efi are picky about the master boot record (MBR). While the AppleTV will eventually boot atv-bootloader with a "wrong" MBR, it might take 30-60 seconds before it tries. We fix this by replacing the MBR with one that was correctly created for Apple EFI boot. 
{{{
#------------------------------------------------
# fix up the MBR to make efi firmware happy and get quick boots
# remember to pick the correct device selection with dd.
wget http://atv-bootloader.googlecode.com/files/mbr_fast-1.0.bin
sudo dd if=mbr_fast-1.0.bin of=/dev/sda bs=512 count=1
}}}

   Ok, that was not too hard, reboot to pickup the changes.
{{{
#------------------------------------------------
# pickup all the changes
sudo reboot
